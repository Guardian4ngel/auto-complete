# Word Jolt 
### A Multilingual Dictionary Website

## Motivation

Popular dictionary websites such as dictionary.com and merriam-webster.com are bogged down with all sorts of junk that make using them slow and unappealing. Word Jolt is designed to be a fast and light-weight web application that is devoid of all sorts of slow loading advertisements and garbage news links.

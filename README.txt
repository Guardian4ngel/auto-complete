Word Jolt: A multi-lingual  dictionary and word completion web application.

Motivation: Popular dictionary websites such as Dictionary.com and merriam-webster.com are bogged down with all sorts of junk that make using them slow and unappealing. The goal of Word-Jolt is to create a lightweight, focused online dictionary.
